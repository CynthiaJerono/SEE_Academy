## 🧐 What Does It Do?

This script asks you for two numbers (decimals are welcome! 🎯), then calculates:

- **Sum** ➕
- **Difference** ➖
- **Product** ✖️
- **Quotient** ➗

It then prints all the results for you to see! 🎉

---

## 📋 Example

```
Enter the first number: 7
Enter the second number: 4
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 11.0
Difference: 3.0
Product: 28.0
Quotient: 1.75
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- **No handling of division by zero!** If you enter 0 as the second number, you'll get an error. (Try not to break math! 😅)
- This script uses `float()` for the inputs, so you can use decimal numbers.

## 🛠️ Want to Make It Better?

- Add zero-division protection!
- Allow the user to repeat calculations without restarting the program
