Hi I just added the calculator.py on SEE-Academy
Basically, we as a class downloaded Git hub, VS cODE AND pYTHON
Copied code from notes and ran it to make it work, code owrked successfully.
Then we initialised the git on git bash by using CD to a folder then made SEE- Academy folder then in it created the .py file.
Configurations were done for both the user name and email..
We then created the repo on git hub...
then followed the procedure to interact git bash and git hub.
